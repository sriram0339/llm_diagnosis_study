      "Symptom: Fingers turning blue\n",
      "response: 1,*Raynaud's Phenomenon*,60%,*This condition is common in young individuals and can cause fingers to turn blue due to spasms in the blood vessels leading to reduced blood flow.*\n",
      "response: 2,*Peripheral Cyanosis*,20%,*The blue discoloration of fingers may be due to reduced oxygen supply in the peripheral parts of the body, often linked with cold exposure or stress.*\n",
      "response: 3,*Acrocyanosis*,10%,*This is a painless and benign condition where the fingers and sometimes toes turn blue, typically due to constriction in small blood vessels.*\n",
      "response: 4,*Congenital Heart Defect*,5%,*Some heart defects can cause reduced oxygenation of blood, leading to symptoms like blue fingers.*\n",
      "response: 5,*Methemoglobinemia*,5%,*This rare condition affects the oxygen-carrying ability of blood and can lead to cyanosis, making extremities appear blue.*\n",
      "Patient: number 399, gender female, age 10, weight 54.0, height 46.0\n",
      "Symptom: shiny skin\n",
      "Symptom: Fingers turning blue\n",
      "Symptom: sore muscles\n",
      "response: 1,*Raynaud's Phenomenon*,40%,*The symptoms of fingers turning blue and shiny skin are characteristic of Raynaud's, a condition that affects blood flow to certain parts of the body—usually the fingers and toes. The sore muscles could be related to the reduced blood flow as well.*\n",
      "response: 2,*Juvenile Dermatomyositis*,30%,*This condition can cause muscle weakness and skin changes, including shiny skin. Sore muscles are a common symptom, and though less typical, circulatory symptoms like fingers turning blue can occur.*\n",
      "response: 3,*Scleroderma*,20%,*Scleroderma can cause shiny skin due to thickening and tightening of the skin, and Raynaud's phenomenon (fingers turning blue) is a common associated symptom. Muscle soreness can also be present due to tissue involvement.*\n",
      "response: 4,*Peripheral Artery Disease*,5%,*Though rare in children, this condition could explain the blue fingers due to poor circulation, and potentially the muscle soreness due to reduced blood supply.*\n",
      "response: 5,*Cold Agglutinin Disease*,5%,*This is a rare condition where cold temperatures can cause red blood cells to clump together, leading to symptoms like fingers turning blue. Muscle soreness is not typical, but could be secondary to reduced blood flow in cold conditions.*\n",

      "Symptom: shiny skin\n",
      "Symptom: Fingers turning blue\n",
      "Symptom: Tight fingers\n",
      "response: 1,*Scleroderma*,40%,*The combination of shiny skin, fingers turning blue, and tight fingers suggests scleroderma, an autoimmune condition characterized by skin thickening and changes in blood vessels, often leading to Raynaud's phenomenon.*\n",
      "response: 2,*Raynaud's Phenomenon*,30%,*The symptom of fingers turning blue, especially when accompanied by shiny skin, could indicate Raynaud's phenomenon, a condition where blood flow to extremities is reduced due to cold or stress, causing color changes.*\n",
      "response: 3,*Juvenile Dermatomyositis*,20%,*This condition involves skin changes and muscle weakness, and while tight skin is not classical, shiny skin and circulation issues could be manifestations of underlying vasculitis.*\n",

      "Symptom: Fingers turning blue\n",
      "response: 1,*Raynaud's Phenomenon*,50%,*The symptoms of fingers turning blue are characteristic of Raynaud's, and hard skin could be an associated feature in cases where Raynaud's is secondary to other conditions like scleroderma.*\n",
      "response: 2,*Scleroderma (localized)*,30%,*Hard skin is a hallmark of scleroderma, and Raynaud's phenomenon can also occur in patients with this condition, leading to blue fingers.*\n",
      "response: 3,*Acrocyanosis*,10%,*This condition is characterized by persistent cyanosis (bluish discoloration) of the fingers, which aligns with the symptom of fingers turning blue.*\n",
      "response: 4,*Chilblains (Pernio)*,5%,*Exposure to cold can cause bluish discoloration of the fingers and hard skin lesions, but this is less likely given the lack of exposure history mentioned.*\n",
      "response: 5,*Digital Ischemia*,5%,*While less common in children, ischemia due to vascular issues could cause blue fingers, but it does not typically cause hard skin.*\n",
