R: 1, Juvenile Dermatomyositis, 75,  The combination of muscle weakness (cannot sit up), skin rashes (on hands and face), red cuticles, and musculoskeletal pain suggest an inflammatory myopathy such as juvenile dermatomyositis. Additional symptoms like fever and bumps under the skin (calcinosis) are consistent with this condition.
R: 2, Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), 60,  Although less common at this age, SLE can present with a variety of symptoms including rash (especially facial rash), fever, musculoskeletal pain, and systemic involvement. The presence of rash, musculoskeletal pain, and fever align with SLE, but the specific symptom of red cuticles is more suggestive of dermatomyositis.
