R: 2, Mixed Connective Tissue Disease (MCTD), 60,  The presence of Raynaud's phenomenon, sicca symptoms, and abnormal esophageal motility suggests a possible overlap syndrome. MCTD can present with features of systemic sclerosis, lupus, and polymyositis, which can account for the wide array of symptoms including fever, lung, and renal involvement.
