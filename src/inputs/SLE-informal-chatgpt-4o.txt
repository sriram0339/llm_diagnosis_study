S:Joint pain
S:Sores in mouth
S:chest pain
S:Abnormal liver function
R: 1, Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA), 40,  The joint pain is a primary symptom of JIA, and in some cases, it can be associated with systemic symptoms such as chest pain and abnormal liver function due to inflammation.
R: 2, Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), 30,  SLE can present with joint pain, oral ulcers, and chest pain due to pleuritis or pericarditis, as well as abnormal liver function tests in children.
R: 3, Viral Hepatitis, 15,  Abnormal liver function can be directly linked to hepatitis, which can also cause systemic symptoms such as joint pain and, in rare cases, mouth sores.
R: 4, Rheumatic Fever, 10,  This condition can cause joint pain and chest pain (due to carditis), though mouth sores are less common, it can impact liver function indirectly through systemic inflammation.
R: 5, Henoch-Schönlein Purpura (HSP), 5,  HSP can cause joint pain and abdominal involvement which may mimic liver dysfunction; however, mouth sores and chest pain are less typical.
P: 999, female, 10, 54.0, 46.0
S:Fever
S:lumps in neck
S:Joint swelling
S:Cannot  tolerate sun
S:Hair loss
S:Protein in urine
S:Poor school performance
S:Pneumonitis 
S:Peritonitis (sterile)
R: 1, Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), 70,  The combination of fever, sun sensitivity, hair loss, proteinuria, and multiple organ involvement (such as pneumonitis and peritonitis), along with joint swelling and lymphadenopathy, strongly suggests SLE, a condition more common in females and can present in childhood with these symptoms.
R: 2, Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) - Systemic Onset, 15,  The presence of joint swelling, fever, and lymphadenopathy could suggest systemic onset JIA, although the sun sensitivity and proteinuria are not typical features, making it less likely than SLE.
R: 3, Henoch-Schönlein Purpura (HSP), 5,  While HSP often presents with joint pain and may involve renal symptoms, the absence of purpura and the presence of sun sensitivity and hair loss make this diagnosis less probable.
R: 4, Kawasaki Disease, 5,  This condition can cause fever, lymphadenopathy, and joint symptoms, but it usually presents with additional symptoms like rash and conjunctivitis; the presence of sun sensitivity and hair loss is atypical for Kawasaki Disease.
R: 5, Mixed Connective Tissue Disease (MCTD), 5,  MCTD can present with overlapping symptoms of autoimmune disorders like SLE and JIA, including joint swelling and sun sensitivity, but it is less likely in this age group and without more specific symptoms.
