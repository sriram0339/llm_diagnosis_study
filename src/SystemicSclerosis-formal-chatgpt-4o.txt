S:Dyspnea 
R: 1, Scleroderma (Localized), 35,  The patient's symptoms of skin tightening and soft tissue contracture are consistent with localized scleroderma, which can affect children. Dyspnea may occur if there is involvement of the lungs or chest wall.
R: 2, Juvenile Dermatomyositis, 25,  This condition can present with skin changes and muscle involvement leading to contractures. The dyspnea might result from respiratory muscle weakness.
R: 3, Mixed Connective Tissue Disease, 20,  This condition can cause overlapping symptoms of autoimmune diseases, including skin tightening and lung issues, which might explain the dyspnea.
R: 4, Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, 15,  Although less common, lupus can present with various systemic symptoms, including skin involvement and lung issues leading to dyspnea.
R: 5, Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, 5,  While not typically associated with dyspnea, some forms of Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome can cause skin changes and joint contractures, but it's less likely given the combination of symptoms.

S:Skin tightening 
S:Rayanud phenomenon
S:Soft tissue contracture
S:Subcutaneous calcification
R: 1, Juvenile Systemic Sclerosis, 75,  The combination of skin tightening, Raynaud phenomenon, soft tissue contracture, and subcutaneous calcification is highly indicative of juvenile systemic sclerosis, a rare autoimmune connective tissue disease in children that affects the skin and internal organs.
R: 2, Localized Scleroderma (Morphea), 15,  Although more common in a different presentation, localized scleroderma can sometimes present with skin tightening and subcutaneous calcification but usually lacks systemic involvement like Raynaud's phenomenon.
R: 3, Mixed Connective Tissue Disease (MCTD), 5,  This condition can present with overlapping features of several connective tissue diseases, including skin issues and Raynaud phenomenon, but is less likely given the specific symptoms of calcification and contractures.
R: 4, Dermatomyositis, 3,  While primarily characterized by muscle weakness and skin changes, dermatomyositis can sometimes lead to calcinosis and contractures, though skin tightening and Raynaud's are less specific to this condition.
R: 5, Calcinosis Cutis, 2,  This condition involves calcium deposits in the skin, which could explain the subcutaneous calcification, but it does not typically present with skin tightening or Raynaud phenomenon as primary features.
P: 248, female, 10, 54.0, 46.0
S:Rayanud phenomenon
S:Soft tissue contracture
S:Muscle weakness and pain
R: 1, Juvenile Dermatomyositis, 40,  The combination of Raynaud phenomenon, muscle weakness and pain, along with soft tissue contracture, is indicative of an inflammatory condition affecting the muscles and skin, which aligns with juvenile dermatomyositis.
R: 2, Juvenile Systemic Sclerosis, 25,  The presence of Raynaud phenomenon and soft tissue contracture suggests a connective tissue disease, and juvenile systemic sclerosis can present with these symptoms along with muscle involvement.
R: 3, Mixed Connective Tissue Disease, 15,  This condition can present with overlap symptoms of different connective tissue diseases, including Raynaud phenomenon, muscle pain, and contractures, making it a possibility in this case.
R: 4, Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA), 10,  Though primarily a joint-related condition, JIA can cause soft tissue contracture and muscle weakness, and occasionally present with Raynaud phenomenon.
R: 5, Polymyositis, 10,  While less common in children, polymyositis can cause muscle weakness and pain, and sometimes be associated with Raynaud phenomenon, particularly in overlap syndromes.
P: 249, female, 10, 54.0, 46.0
S:Skin tightening 
S:Rayanud phenomenon
S:Soft tissue contracture
S:Dysphagia
R: 1, Systemic Sclerosis (Scleroderma), 85,  The combination of skin tightening, Raynaud phenomenon, and soft tissue contractures are classic signs of systemic sclerosis. Dysphagia is also common due to esophageal involvement in this condition.
R: 2, Mixed Connective Tissue Disease (MCTD), 60,  This condition can present with symptoms overlapping those of systemic sclerosis, including Raynaud phenomenon and dysphagia, alongside other connective tissue disease features.
R: 3, Juvenile Dermatomyositis, 40,  While more typically associated with muscle weakness, dermatomyositis can cause skin changes and contractures. However, the presence of Raynaud's phenomenon and dysphagia is less common, making it slightly less likely.
R: 4, Eosinophilic Fasciitis, 25,  Characterized by skin tightening and contractures, but less commonly associated with Raynaud's and dysphagia, making it a less likely fit for the symptoms.
R: 5, CREST Syndrome (Limited Scleroderma), 20,  This is a form of scleroderma that includes Raynaud's and esophageal dysmotility, but the typical skin involvement is often more limited, making it a less probable match compared to systemic sclerosis.
