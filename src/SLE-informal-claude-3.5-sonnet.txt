R: 1, Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), 40,  Combination of joint pain, oral ulcers, chest pain, and abnormal liver function is highly suggestive of SLE, which commonly affects young females.
R: 2, Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA), 25,  Joint pain is a primary symptom, and some forms of JIA can affect internal organs, potentially explaining the abnormal liver function and chest pain.
R: 3, Kawasaki Disease, 15,  Can cause joint pain, mouth sores, and affect the heart (chest pain) and liver in children, though the patient is slightly older than the typical age range.
R: 4, Lyme Disease, 10,  Can cause joint pain, and in later stages, can affect multiple organs including the heart and liver, potentially explaining the chest pain and abnormal liver function.
R: 5, Viral Hepatitis, 5,  Could explain the abnormal liver function, and some forms can cause joint pain and mouth sores, though chest pain is less common.
P: 999, female, 10, 54.0, 46.0

S:Peritonitis (sterile)
R: 1, Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), 75,  Matches multiple symptoms including fever, joint swelling, photosensitivity, hair loss, proteinuria, and potential organ involvement (pneumonitis, peritonitis)
R: 2, Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA), 60,  Explains fever, joint swelling, and lymphadenopathy (neck lumps); can also cause fatigue affecting school performance
R: 3, Lymphoma, 40,  Could account for fever, lymphadenopathy, and systemic symptoms; less likely due to autoimmune features
R: 4, Mixed Connective Tissue Disease, 35,  Shares features with lupus and can cause joint swelling, fever, and organ involvement
R: 5, Lyme Disease, 25,  Can cause fever, joint swelling, and fatigue; less likely due to lack of typical rash and other specific symptoms
