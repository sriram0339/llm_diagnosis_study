R: 5, Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (Systemic onset), 30,  Arthritis, fever, and systemic involvement (cardiac, CNS) are consistent, but sclerodermatous skin and Raynaud's phenomenon are not typical features.

R: 1, Juvenile Dermatomyositis, 85,  Presence of characteristic skin rash (Gottron's papules), muscle weakness, and multi-system involvement typical of this autoimmune condition in children
R: 2, Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), 60,  Multi-system involvement, including arthritis, Raynaud's phenomenon, and pericarditis, which are common in pediatric SLE
R: 3, Mixed Connective Tissue Disease, 45,  Combination of symptoms from various autoimmune disorders, including Raynaud's phenomenon, arthritis, and muscle disease
R: 4, Systemic Sclerosis (Scleroderma), 30,  Presence of Raynaud's phenomenon, esophageal motility issues, and restrictive lung disease, though less common in children
R: 5, Polymyositis, 20,  Muscle disease and potential multi-system involvement, but lacks the characteristic skin findings of dermatomyositis

S:Raynaud's phenomenon
S:Gottron's papules

R: 1, Juvenile Dermatomyositis, 75,  Combination of arthritis, Gottron's papules, muscle disease, and Raynaud's phenomenon strongly suggests this autoimmune condition affecting children.
R: 2, Systemic Sclerosis (Scleroderma), 60,  Raynaud's phenomenon, esophageal motility issues, and restrictive lung disease are characteristic of this connective tissue disorder.
R: 3, Mixed Connective Tissue Disease, 50,  Presents with overlapping features of various autoimmune disorders, including arthritis, Raynaud's, and lung involvement.
R: 4, Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), 40,  Can cause arthritis, Raynaud's, and CNS involvement, though some symptoms are less typical for SLE.
R: 5, Polymyositis, 30,  Muscle disease and lung involvement are consistent, but lack of skin manifestations makes this less likely than dermatomyositis.

R: 1, Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), 70,  Multiple organ involvement including joints, skin, heart, and CNS is characteristic of SLE; common in young females
R: 2, Juvenile Dermatomyositis, 60,  Muscle disease and skin involvement (Raynaud's) are key features; can affect multiple organ systems including lungs
R: 3, Mixed Connective Tissue Disease, 50,  Combination of symptoms from various autoimmune diseases, including Raynaud's, arthritis, and muscle involvement
R: 4, Juvenile Systemic Sclerosis, 40,  Can cause Raynaud's, arthritis, restrictive lung disease, and heart involvement; less common but possible in children
R: 5, Polyarteritis Nodosa, 30,  Can affect multiple organ systems including joints, skin, heart, and CNS; less common in children but possible
