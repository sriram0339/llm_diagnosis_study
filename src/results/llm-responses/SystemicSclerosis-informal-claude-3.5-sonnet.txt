R: 3, Mixed Connective Tissue Disease, 15,  Combination of symptoms including Raynaud's, muscle tenderness, and skin changes common in pediatric cases
R: 4, Juvenile Dermatomyositis, 7,  Autoimmune condition causing muscle weakness, tenderness, and skin changes in children
R: 5, Lupus (Systemic Lupus Erythematosus), 3,  Can present with skin changes, muscle pain, and Raynaud's-like symptoms, though less common in young children
P: 997, female, 10, 54.0, 46.0
S:Hard skin
S:Tight joint
S:Tender muscles
S:Trouble swallowing liquids
R: 1, Scleroderma (Systemic Sclerosis), 45,  Young female patient presenting with classic symptoms of hardened skin, joint involvement, and difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) which are hallmark features of juvenile scleroderma
R: 2, Dermatomyositis, 25,  Pediatric inflammatory condition that can cause muscle tenderness, skin changes, and swallowing difficulties, commonly affecting young females
R: 3, Mixed Connective Tissue Disease, 15,  Autoimmune disorder that can present with overlapping symptoms of muscle tenderness, skin changes, and joint problems in young patients
R: 4, Polymyositis, 10,  Inflammatory muscle disease that causes muscle tenderness and can affect swallowing, though skin hardening is not typically present
R: 5, GVHD (Graft Versus Host Disease), 5,  Can cause skin hardening and joint problems, though less likely without a history of stem cell transplantation
P: 998, female, 10, 54.0, 46.0
S:Hard skin
S:Cold hands
S:Tight joint
S:Bumps under skin
R: 1, Scleroderma, 45,  Young female patient with characteristic symptoms of hardened skin, cold extremities (Raynaud's phenomenon), joint involvement, and subcutaneous nodules; matches typical presentation
R: 2, Juvenile Dermatomyositis, 25,  Autoimmune condition common in children that can cause skin changes, subcutaneous calcifications, and joint problems
R: 3, Mixed Connective Tissue Disease, 15,  Overlapping features of various autoimmune conditions including skin changes and joint involvement; can affect children
R: 4, Morphea, 10,  Localized form of scleroderma that causes hardened patches of skin and can occur in children; less likely due to systemic symptoms
R: 5, Eosinophilic Fasciitis, 5,  Rare condition causing skin hardening and joint contractures, but less common in children and typically affects limbs more than hands
P: 999, female, 10, 54.0, 46.0
S:Hard skin
S:Fingers turning blue
S:Bumps under skin
R: 1, Scleroderma, 45,  A rare autoimmune condition that causes hardening of the skin, and commonly presents with Raynaud's phenomenon (blue fingers) and skin nodules; these match all three symptoms
R: 2, Raynaud's Disease, 25,  Primary condition causing fingers to turn blue in response to cold or stress, can be associated with skin changes and nodules, though typically not as severe hardening
R: 3, Lupus, 15,  Autoimmune disease that can cause skin changes, vascular problems leading to blue fingers, and inflammatory nodules under the skin
R: 4, Mixed Connective Tissue Disease, 10,  Overlap condition that combines features of several autoimmune diseases, including skin changes, Raynaud's phenomenon, and nodular formations
R: 5, Dermatomyositis, 5,  Rare inflammatory condition that can cause skin hardening, vascular changes, and nodules, though typically also presents with muscle weakness which isn't mentioned here
