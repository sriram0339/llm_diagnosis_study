S:Cuts on hands
R: 1, Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis, 50,  The patient presents with joint pain and stiffness (cannot sit up), fatigue, hand rash, and rash on eyelids which are consistent with Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis. Bumps on the neck might be lymph nodes swelling due to the autoimmune process.
R: 2, Juvenile Dermatomyositis, 20,  Juvenile Dermatomyositis can present with fatigue, rash on eyelids, hand rash, and muscle weakness which can manifest as difficulty sitting up. Red cuticles may be a sign of nailfold capillary abnormalities seen in this condition.
R: 3, Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, 15,  Frequent falls can be seen in Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome due to joint hypermobility and poor proprioception. Cuts on hands can be due to fragile skin in this condition.
R: 4, Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, 10,  The patient's symptoms of fatigue, rash on eyelids, hand rash, and joint pain can be seen in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus. Red cuticles may be due to vasculitis commonly seen in Lupus.
R: 5, Juvenile Idiopathic Dermatomyositis, 5,  Juvenile Idiopathic Dermatomyositis can present with fatigue, rash on eyelids, hand rash, and muscle weakness leading to difficulty sitting up. The bumps on the neck may be due to enlarged lymph nodes related to the autoimmune process.
