# debug Juvenile Systemic Sclerosis --> The symptoms of hard skin, cold hands, tight fingers, and pain are characteristic of juvenile systemic sclerosis, an autoimmune condition that causes skin thickening and can affect children. --> ['Hard skin', 'Cold hands', 'Tight fingers', 'Pain'], Unmentioned []
# debug Juvenile Scleroderma --> The combination of hard skin, cold hands, tight joints, musculoskeletal pain, and subcutaneous nodules strongly suggests juvenile scleroderma, a condition characterized by skin hardening and systemic involvement. --> ['Hard skin', 'Cold hands', 'Tight joint', 'Musculoskeletal pain', 'Bumps under skin'], Unmentioned []
# debug Scleroderma --> The combination of shiny skin and tight joints is suggestive of scleroderma, a condition characterized by skin thickening and tightening, which can also cause Raynaud's phenomenon as an early symptom. --> ['shiny skin', 'Tight joint'], Unmentioned ['Fingers turnng white']
# debug Scleroderma (Localized) --> The symptoms of hard skin, tight fingers, and bumps under the skin are characteristic of localized scleroderma, which can occur in children and often affects the skin, causing it to thicken and harden. Raynaud's phenomenon, which causes fingers to turn blue, is also commonly associated with this condition. --> ['Hard skin', 'Fingers turning blue', 'Tight fingers', 'Bumps under skin'], Unmentioned []
# debug Juvenile Systemic Sclerosis --> The combination of shiny skin, finger discoloration (turning blue), tight joints, and pain suggests systemic sclerosis, a condition that can cause skin thickening and vascular changes, including Raynaud's phenomenon, which aligns with the symptoms presented. --> ['shiny skin', 'Fingers turning blue', 'Tight joint', 'Pain'], Unmentioned []
# debug Systemic Sclerosis (Scleroderma) --> The combination of hard skin, tight fingers, blue discoloration of fingers (Raynaud's phenomenon), and bumps under the skin (calcinosis) strongly suggest systemic sclerosis, a condition commonly associated with these symptoms. --> ['Hard skin', 'Fingers turning blue', 'Tight fingers', 'Bumps under skin', 'shortness of breath with exertion'], Unmentioned ['Pain']
# debug Juvenile Scleroderma --> The symptoms of hard skin, tight joints, and pain are characteristic of scleroderma, a condition that involves the hardening and tightening of the skin and connective tissues, and it can occur in children as juvenile scleroderma. --> ['Hard skin', 'Tight joint', 'Pain'], Unmentioned []
# debug Juvenile Systemic Sclerosis --> The combination of shiny skin and musculoskeletal pain suggests possible early signs of systemic sclerosis, which can cause skin thickening and joint pain, especially in young females. --> ['shiny skin', 'Musculoskeletal pain'], Unmentioned ['Fingers turning blue']
# debug Scleroderma --> The hard skin and tight joints are classic symptoms of scleroderma, an autoimmune disease that affects the connective tissues. The symptom of fingers turning blue (Raynaud's phenomenon) is also commonly associated with this condition. --> ['Hard skin', 'Fingers turning blue', 'Tight joint'], Unmentioned []
# debug Systemic Sclerosis (Scleroderma) --> The presence of shiny skin along with digital color changes such as blue fingers could suggest scleroderma, although less common in children. --> ['shiny skin', 'Fingers turning blue'], Unmentioned []
# debug Juvenile Scleroderma --> The symptoms of cold hands, tight fingers, and muscle pain are consistent with juvenile scleroderma, a condition that affects the skin and connective tissues and can cause tightening and pain. --> ['Cold hands', 'Tight fingers', 'Muscle pain'], Unmentioned []
# debug Scleroderma --> This autoimmune condition involves hardening and tightening of the skin and connective tissues, which matches the hard skin symptom. It often presents with Raynaud's Phenomenon, which could explain the patient's fingers turning blue. --> ['Hard skin', 'Fingers turning blue'], Unmentioned []
# debug Scleroderma --> The combination of shiny skin, tight fingers, and Raynaud's phenomenon (fingers turning white) are classic symptoms of scleroderma, an autoimmune disorder that affects the skin and connective tissues. --> ['shiny skin', 'Fingers turnng white', 'Tight fingers'], Unmentioned ['Pain', 'Tender muscles']
# debug Scleroderma --> The combination of hard skin, tight joints, and trouble swallowing liquids suggests scleroderma, a connective tissue disease characterized by fibrosis, vascular alterations, and autoantibodies. --> ['Hard skin', 'Tight joint', 'Trouble swallowing liquids'], Unmentioned ['Tender muscles']
# debug Juvenile Scleroderma --> The symptoms of hard skin, cold hands, tight joints, and bumps under the skin are characteristic of scleroderma, an autoimmune disorder that can present in children as juvenile scleroderma. --> ['Hard skin', 'Cold hands', 'Tight joint', 'Bumps under skin'], Unmentioned []
